Project Overview:

This project is a simple Java console application that demonstrates how to connect a Java program to a database using JDBC.
The application successfully establishes a database connection, executes an SQL query, and retrieves account balance information
from the database. After executing the process, the balance amount is displayed in the console. The sample output shows a successful
connection message followed by the retrieved balance value (BALANCE: 3000.0).

This project was developed using Java and Eclipse IDE. It helps in understanding basic JDBC concepts such as database connectivity, 
executing SQL queries, handling ResultSet, and managing exceptions. The application can be configured by updating the database URL, 
username, and password in the source code.

Overall, this project is useful for beginners who want to learn how Java interacts with databases using JDBC and how to display 
retrieved data in a console-based application.
